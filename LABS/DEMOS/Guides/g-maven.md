***MAVEN GUIDE***


1. **What is Maven?**
   - Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.
   - It simplifies the build process by automating tasks such as compiling, packaging, and testing.
   - Maven uses a project object model (POM) to define project configurations and dependencies.
   - It provides a standard way to manage dependencies, build processes, and project structure.
   - Maven is widely used in the Java ecosystem and is a key component of many Java development workflows.
2. **What is build-automation?**
   - Build automation refers to the process of automating the build process of a software project.
   - It involves using tools and scripts to automate tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging artifacts, and deploying applications.
   - Build automation helps streamline the software development lifecycle by reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.
   - It allows developers to focus on writing code and less on repetitive tasks.
   - Common build automation tools include Maven, Gradle, and Jenkins.
3. **Why use Maven?**
   - Maven simplifies the build process by automating tasks such as compiling, packaging, and testing.
   - It provides a standard way to manage dependencies, build processes, and project structure.
   - Maven helps ensure consistency across projects and promotes collaboration among developers.
   - It provides a central repository for dependencies, making it easier to manage and update dependencies.
   - Maven supports various build profiles, allowing developers to customize the build process based on different environments or configurations.
4. **How to use Maven?**
   - To use Maven, you need to have Maven installed on your system.
   - Once installed, you can create a new Maven project by running the `mvn archetype:generate` command.
   - Maven uses a POM (Project Object Model) file to define project configurations and dependencies.
   - You can configure the POM file to specify project details, dependencies, build plugins, and more.
   - To build the project, run the `mvn clean install` command.
   - Maven will execute the build process based on the configurations specified in the POM file.
   - You can also use Maven plugins
5. **What is a POM?**
   - A POM (Project Object Model) is a configuration file used in Maven to define project configurations and dependencies.
   - It contains information about the project, such as project name, version, dependencies, build plugins, and more.
   - The POM file is located in the project's root directory and is named `pom.xml`.
