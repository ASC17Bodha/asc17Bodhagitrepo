# Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements

## Differences

| Functional Requirements | Non-Functional Requirements |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Define what the system should do | Define how the system should perform |
| Specific features and behaviors | Quality attributes and constraints |
| User-visible features | Background system characteristics |
| Can be tested with clear pass/fail results | Often measured on a scale |
| Example: User login feature | Example: System response time |

## Functional Requirements
- Describe specific system behaviors and functions
- Define user interactions and system responses
- Specify data processing and business rules
- Include input/output requirements
- Examples:
  - User registration
  - Payment processing
  - Data validation
  - Report generation
  - Search functionality

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Define system qualities and constraints
- Address performance characteristics
- Specify security measures
- Include technical and design constraints
- Examples:
  - Performance: Response time < 2 seconds
  - Scalability: Support 10,000 concurrent users
  - Security: Data encryption standards
  - Reliability: 99.9% uptime
  - Usability: Mobile-responsive design
