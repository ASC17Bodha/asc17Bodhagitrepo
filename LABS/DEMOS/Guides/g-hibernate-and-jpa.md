1. **What is Hibernate?**
   - Hibernate is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java.
   - It provides a framework for mapping Java objects to relational databases.
   - Hibernate allows developers to work with databases using Java objects, eliminating the need to write SQL queries manually.
   - Hibernate provides features such as automatic object-relational mapping, lazy loading, caching, and more.
   - Hibernate supports various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more.
   - Hibernate is widely used in enterprise applications and is known for its flexibility and performance.
   **What is JPA
   - JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications.
   - JPA is a standard API that defines a set of interfaces and annotations for mapping Java objects to relational databases.
   - JPA provides a common way to interact with databases, regardless of the underlying database technology.
   - JPA abstracts the details of database interactions, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than database-specific code.
   - JPA supports various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more.
   - JPA is widely used in enterprise applications and is known for its simplicity and portability.
   **What is the difference between Hibernate and JPA?**
   - Hibernate is an ORM framework that provides a framework for mapping Java objects to relational databases.
   - JPA is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications.
   - Hibernate is a framework that provides a set of tools and libraries for working with databases using Java objects.
   - JPA is a specification that defines a set of interfaces and annotations for mapping Java objects to relational databases.
   - Hibernate is a popular ORM framework that is widely used in enterprise applications.
   - JPA is a standard API
   - Hibernate provides features such as automatic object-relational mapping, lazy loading, caching, and more.


   ## JPA vs Hibernate

| Feature | JPA | Hibernate |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| Type | Specification/Standard | Implementation |
| Purpose | Defines standard interfaces and annotations | ORM Framework with concrete implementation |
| Scope | Only specification, no implementation | Full featured ORM implementation |
| Dependencies | javax.persistence package | Multiple Hibernate specific packages |
| Configuration | persistence.xml | hibernate.cfg.xml or properties |
| Flexibility | Limited to standard features | Additional features beyond JPA spec |
| Portability | High (works with any JPA provider) | Specific to Hibernate implementation |
| Learning Curve | Simpler (standard API) | Steeper (more features to learn)
